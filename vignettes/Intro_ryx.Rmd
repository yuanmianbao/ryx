This is an introduction to my wonderful package ryx.
You just need to tell me what data set and which variable(s) you are interested in
and I will tell you the correlation among them. 

You can use this package like this: 
```{r}
library(MASS)
x <- ryx(Boston, y="medv")
print.ryx(x, digits=3)
summary.ryx(x)
plot.ryx(x)
```
